## end user value of ProvisionGenie

Purpose of this app is to foster teamwork by letting owners-to-be of Microsoft Teams teams make smarter decisions on how a team can work in Teams. Usually, a business consultant would talk a team through assets that are available in Teams and Microsoft 365 and answer all questions with 'it depends'. They would explain that people usually

* confuse chat with task assignments "could you please"
* confuse email with status reports "per my last email"
* confuse SharePoint with a dumpster for any file in the world --> "can you migrate this pile of mess to someone else's computer?"

The consultant would then show them what channels are made for, how a team can work with metadata on files and how stying on track works with Microsoft Lists. The consultant would ask them also if they wanted more learning material pinned to their brand new team and if they wanted the team of they dreams already be created for them, so that it works from Day 1. This is, what Provisiongenie does. Users get a blended experience of 

- learning about modern collaboration and assets that can be used in Teams and 
- reflecting on how they want to work in Teams.

## Overall complexity to deploy and maintain ProvisionGenie

To get a better understanding of ProvisionGenie we highly recommend to familiarize yourself first with our [Solution overview](https://github.com/ProvisionGenie/ProvisionGenie/blob/main/Docs/SolutionOverview.md). Additionally we provide you with a pictured step by step [Deployment Guide](DeploymentGuide.md) that walks you through the entire deployment. If something doesn't work you can always [raise an issue](https://github.com/ProvisionGenie/ProvisionGenie/issues/new/choose) and we will help. We don't believe that you will experience major difficulties, as we of course tested the deployment before.
