**Guidance & Provisioning for Microsoft Teams**

This app lets you learn how Microsoft Teams works in general and how you can make it particularly work for your team. As Teams is a platform that can connect to a lot of services, we want to make your start even easier. We will skill you up and guide you through some questions regarding how your Team should look like. As a result, you can request the 'Team of your dreams', which will be provisioned automatically for you.
