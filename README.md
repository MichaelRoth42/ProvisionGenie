![Genie Header image](https://github.com/ProvisionGenie/ProvisionGenie/blob/main/media/Communication/Genie_Header.png)

ProvisionGenie is an app for [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) that lets you learn how your team can work best in Microsoft Teams. As Teams is a platform that can connect to a lot of services, we want to make your start even easier. We will

* skill you up and
* guide you through some questions regarding how your team should look like.

üëâAs a result, you can request the 'Team of your dreams', which will be provisioned automatically ü¶Ñ for you.
